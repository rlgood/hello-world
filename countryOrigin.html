									<h1>Predicting Country of Origin</h1>
								</header>

								<p>
									This project was an assignment for my data mining class. We investigated data from the World Value Survey Version 7,
									the survey includes over 250 questions ranging from religion to life satisfaction. Our project was to create a model
									to predict country of origin from responses of citizens from the USA and Mexico. We were tasked with creating the
									project in RStudio and KNIME.
								</p>

								<hr class="major" />

								<h2>Dependent and Independent Variables</h2>
								<p>
									B_COUNTRY is a nominal variable that specifies the respondent country of origin code.
									The code for Mexico is ‘484’ and for USA is ‘840’. These two countries will be acting as my dependent variables.
									The following survey questions were used as my independent variables:

									<br /> - Q7 references encouraging children to learn good manners at home as being especially important.
									<br /> - Q35 references the respondent’s agreement with the statement “if a woman earns more
									money than her husband, it’s almost certain to cause problems.”
									<br /> - Q116 references belief that civil service providers (police, judiciary, civil servants, doctors,
									teachers) are involved in corruption.
									<br /> - Q143 references the degree of worry the respondent has in not being able to give their children a good education.
									<br /> - Q164 references the importance of God in the respondent’s life.
									<br /> - Q213 references participating in political action and social activism by donating to a group or campaign.
									<br /> - Q255 references how close the respondent feels to their village, town, or city.

											<br />With the importance of family and being a good host in Mexican culture this distribution makes sense.

											The distribution of responsed in USA for Q35(high earning wife) where 1 is "Agree strongly" and 5 is
											"Disagree strongly"
											<br />With weaker traditional gender roles in US families this distribution makes sense. Its interesting
											that none of the respondents agreed or disagreed strongly.
